# Description
A function pointer, also called a subroutine pointer or procedure pointer, is a pointer that points to a function. As opposed to referencing a data value, a function pointer points to executable code within memory.Function pointers can be used to simplify code by providing a simple way to select a function to execute based on run-time values.  
In this program, you need to finish function *PF maxmin(int c)* where typedef *int (*PF)(int,int)*. In *maxmin* function, the program will return *max* funtion if c == 1, return *min* function otherwise.  
# Input
Two numbers a, b and a control number c.  
# Output
if c == 1  
output the maximum in a, b  
if c != 1  
output the minimum in a, b  
# Example input
>4 2  
1  
# Example output
>4  
# Hint
Function pointer
