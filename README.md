# Description
From Wikipedia In computer science, a list or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a countable number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once. An instance of a list is a computer representation of the mathematical concept of a finite sequence; the (potentially) infinite analog of a list is a stream.[1]:ยง3.5 Lists are a basic example of containers, as they contain other values. If the same value occurs multiple times, each occurrence is considered a distinct item.  
In this section, you need to construct a static list from an array. Be careful the last item points to NULL next  
# Input
In the first line, there is a number n. In the second line, there are n Integers.  
# Ouput
Construct a static list and output it.  
# Example input
>3  
1 2 3  
# Example output
>1 2 3
