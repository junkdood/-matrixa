# Description
From Wikipedia  
Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961 it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsortã€‚  
# Input
In the first line, there is a number n(1 <= n <= 100000), which means the size of array. In the following line, there are n integers.  
# Output
The ascending order of the array.  
# Example input
>2  
2 1
