# Description  
Give you two integers, and calculate their GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM(Least Common Multiple). If both of them are positive, print the GCD and LCM. If some are invalid(zero or negative), print invalid.  

# input  
First line is the integer tâˆˆ[1,100], which indicates how many tests will be performed. Next, in each line of the n lines, there are two intergers ai in [0, 10000] and bi in [0, 10000].  

# output  
If both of them are positive, print the GCD and LCM. If some are invalid(zero or negative), print invalid.  

# Sample Input  
2  
0 10  
2 10  
# Sample Output  
invalid  
2 10  
# Hint  
You may not learn the algorithms of calculating LCM and GCD in your primary school or middle school. So you can serach about them, or read the instruction in wikipedia about Least Common Multiple and Greatest Common Divisor.
