# Description
Given sorted array Array and one of a num a in Array, the program answers the index of the num a in Array.  
the size of Array is [1, 100000].  
All of integers in Array are different.  
# Input
There are 3+m lines. 0 <= m <= size of Array In the first line, there is a number n which means the size of Array. In the second line, there are n numbers. In the third line, there is a number m which means the number of query. In the following m lines, there is a number in the array in each line.  
# Output
There are m lines. In each line, there is a number which means the index of the query.  
# Example input
>3  
1 2 3  
2  
1  
2  
# Example output
0
